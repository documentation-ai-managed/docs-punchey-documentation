## Tips and taxes at a glance

Punchey allows you to add tips and apply taxes as part of your normal checkout or invoicing workflow. Tips can be configured as suggested amounts or left open for customers to enter their own values. Taxes are calculated based on the rates you set for your location and product or service categories. Detailed setup steps are available in the Resource Center.

## Where this fits with money flow

For a broader view of how payments, deposits, fees, tips, and taxes ultimately move through your account, see the conceptual guide titled How Money Moves with Punchey. It explains the end‑to‑end flow so you can better understand how your payouts align with daily activity.

## Payment states and common edge cases

Businesses may occasionally see transactions that do not complete as expected. These situations are typically straightforward once you know what to look for:

- Declines often occur due to insufficient funds, incorrect card details, or bank security checks. You can view the decline reason in your payment activity list.

- Partial approvals may appear when a card has limited available balance. In these cases, the card covers part of the amount, and you can collect the remaining balance using another method.

- Expired or outdated cards typically fail during authorization. The customer may need to update their payment information before retrying.

- Voids and refunds appear differently depending on whether settlement has occurred. Your payment activity timeline shows whether money is still moving or has already been returned.

## Deposits versus full payments

Deposits help businesses secure commitment before work begins or materials are prepared. A deposit records partial payment up front and reduces the remaining balance owed on the final invoice.

- The deposit and the final payment appear as related but separate entries in your records.

- When the final payment is collected, the customer sees the remaining balance only, not the amount already deposited.

- Your payout activity reflects each payment as it settles, which may occur on different days.

  Deposits can be especially useful for appointments, custom orders, and services that require advance preparation.

## Handling split payments

Split payments allow a customer to pay using more than one method at checkout, such as part card and part cash.

- Each portion of the split is recorded as its own line in the payment activity list.

- The invoice or ticket shows the combined total as fully paid, while your records clearly identify which methods were used.

- This can simplify end‑of‑day reconciliation by showing how much of a sale was collected by each payment method.

  If a customer wants to divide a bill among multiple people or methods, you can apply each amount one at a time until the balance reaches zero.
