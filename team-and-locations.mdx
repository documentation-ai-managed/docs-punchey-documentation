## How teams and locations fit together

Punchey is designed for businesses with multiple employees, shared work areas, and sometimes more than one physical location. This guide explains how to think about user accounts, permissions, stations, and customer-facing devices so your team can stay organized and secure without added complexity.

## Typical roles and why separate accounts matter

Each person who uses Punchey should sign in with an individual user account. This keeps activity traceable, protects sensitive settings, and supports clean reporting.

### Common roles

- **Owner or admin**\
  Has full access, including billing, security settings, and organization-wide configuration.

- **Manager**\
  Oversees day-to-day operations, staff performance, schedules, and approvals. Manages most non-financial settings.

- **Front desk**\
  Handles customer check-in, scheduling, and payment workflows at shared registers or reception areas.

- **Staff or service provider**\
  Views their schedule, manages their appointments, and completes check-out workflows for their own clients.

### Why individual accounts help

- Accurate appointment, sales, and performance reporting.

- Clear responsibility for actions completed in the system.

- Granular permission control as the team grows.

- Safer password and access management across locations.

## How locations and stations work

A location represents a physical business address. Inside each location, you can set up **stations**, which include desktop registers, tablets, and mobile devices used by team members or customers.

### Stations and daily workflows

- **Registers or desktop stations**\
  The primary work area for front desk staff and managers. Used for check-in, scheduling, and processing payments.

- **Customer-facing SignPad tablets**\
  Companion tablets used for digital forms, consent capture, signatures, tipping, and card reader interactions. These devices stay pointed toward the customer in a dual-screen setup.

- **Mobile devices**\
  Punchey offers mobile companion apps for Android and iOS. Staff can view schedules, adjust appointments, and process payments while away from the front desk.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  Think of stations as shared tools, while user accounts represent people. A single station can be used by many users throughout the day, but each user should still sign in individually.
</Callout>

### Typical setup at a single location

A simple daily configuration often looks like this:

- One or more desktop registers for front desk and management.

- A SignPad tablet at each register for customer-facing interactions.

- Optional mobile devices used by staff during appointments or offsite work.

## Keeping access organized and secure

As your team expands, a few habits help keep your system clean and secure.
