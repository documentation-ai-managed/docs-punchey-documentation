## What you can manage in your account

Your Punchey account dashboard centralizes key administrative controls for your business. Here you can review your user access settings, adjust your basic account information, and manage the billing details that keep your service active.

## User access and logins

You can view and manage who can sign in to your Punchey system. Typical actions include:

- Adding or removing team members

- Updating login credentials

- Adjusting permissions for day-to-day operations

These settings help you keep your workspace secure and ensure the right people have the right access.

## Account and business settings

Your account section includes basic business and profile details. You may update information such as:

- Business contact details

- Operational preferences

- Notification or communication settings

Keeping this information current helps ensure that your billing and service communications reach the right place.

## Billing details and payment history

Your billing tools allow you to:

- Update the card or bank details used to pay for Punchey

- Review past invoices and payments

- Confirm your current plan and renewal information

If you change billing information, the update applies to all future charges.

## Billing model and fees

Punchey uses a straightforward billing model that typically includes:

- Your selected software plan, which renews on a recurring schedule

- Processing fees associated with transactions you run through Punchey

- Applicable taxes or regulatory fees, depending on your location and payment volume

Most merchants see these charges reflected in two places:

- Invoices for software plans and subscription-related charges

- Payment reports that outline processing fees, adjustments, and any taxes associated with payments you collect

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  Processing fees are usually deducted from payouts instead of appearing as a separate bill. Review your payment history to understand how fees relate to each deposit.

## Learn more about payouts and fees

For a broader explanation of how charges, fees, and refunds flow through your account, refer to the How Money Moves with Punchey page. It provides a high-level walkthrough of how transactions are processed from payment to payout.

## Managing access to your account

Several everyday tasks help you keep your account secure and your billing information current:

- **Changing your password**\
  Update your own login credentials when needed, especially after device changes or security concerns.

- **Updating payment information**\
  Replace expired cards or adjust the bank account used for software billing so service remains uninterrupted.

- **Reviewing billing history**\
  View past invoices and payments to confirm charges, understand plan changes, or share records with your bookkeeper.

- **Managing or cancelling your subscription**\
  If your needs change, you can review current plans, adjust add‑ons, or request cancellation. Cancellation affects ongoing access to software features and should be coordinated with your team.

These actions are typically restricted to owners or administrators with access to account‑level settings.
