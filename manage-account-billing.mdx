## User access and logins

You can view and manage who can sign in to your Punchey system. Typical actions include:

- Adding or removing team members
- Updating login credentials
- Adjusting permissions for day-to-day operations

These settings help you keep your workspace secure and ensure the right people have the right access.

## Account and business settings

Your account section includes basic business and profile details. You may update information such as:

- Business contact details
- Operational preferences
- Notification or communication settings

Keeping this information current helps ensure that your billing and service communications reach the right place.

## Billing details and payment history

Your billing tools allow you to:

- Update the card or bank details used to pay for Punchey
- Review past invoices and payments
- Confirm your current plan and renewal information

If you change billing information, the update applies to all future charges.

## Billing model and fees

Punchey uses a straightforward billing model that typically includes:

- Your selected software plan, which renews on a recurring schedule
- Processing fees associated with transactions you run through Punchey
- Applicable taxes or regulatory fees, depending on your location and payment volume

Most merchants see these charges reflected in two places:

- Invoices for software plans and subscription-related charges
- Payment reports that outline processing fees, adjustments, and any taxes associated with payments you collect

<Callout kind="tip">

Processing fees are usually deducted from payouts instead of appearing as a separate bill. Review your payment history to understand how fees relate to each deposit.
