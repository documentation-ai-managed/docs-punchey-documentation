## What the mobile app is for

The Punchey mobile app gives you quick access when you are away from the front desk. It is designed for checking your day, staying connected to customers, and handling simple tasks while on the move. It is not meant to replace every configuration or setup screen available on desktop.

The app is ideal for fast, lightweight actions. For deeper setup, reporting, and management work, use the desktop dashboard.

## Typical mobile use cases

Staff and owners can handle many everyday needs from their phone. Common examples include:

- Viewing the daily or weekly schedule.
- Opening customer profiles to see important visit details.
- Adjusting or confirming appointments.
- Monitoring new online bookings and cancellations.
- Taking simple payments where supported.

These features help you stay organized during busy days without needing to return to a workstation.

## How mobile fits with locations and stations

The mobile app connects to the same team, location, and station setup used on desktop. Your login reflects your role and assigned location. Activity performed on mobile contributes to reporting in the same way that activity at a register or tablet does.

Staff accounts represent real people, while stations represent shared equipment like registers or check-in tablets. Mobile access gives each team member their own view without affecting station assignments.

If you manage multiple locations, the mobile app helps you see how each one is progressing throughout the day.

## Owner view vs. staff view

Owners often use the mobile app to monitor:

- How the day is unfolding across locations.
- Key appointments or customer visits.
- Urgent booking changes or cancellations.

Front-line staff typically use the app to:

- Check their schedule between appointments.
- Review customer notes before a visit.
- Make quick adjustments when plans change.
- Accept simple payments in supported setups.

Both groups benefit from being able to handle time-sensitive tasks without returning to the front desk.

## Security on mobile devices

Because mobile devices travel with you, good security habits are important. Keep your device locked with a passcode or biometric unlock, and make sure you fully log out when finished. If a device is lost or stolen, update your account password and contact your administrator so they can remove access.

<Callout kind="alert">

Treat your mobile device like any other business tool. A secure phone protects your customers and your business.
