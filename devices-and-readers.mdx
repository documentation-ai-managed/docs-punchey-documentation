## Understanding supported devices

Punchey works with a range of common point-of-sale hardware. You can combine these devices to fit your checkout setup:

- Chip and contactless card readers for secure in-person payments

- Magstripe readers for basic swipe transactions

- Registers for taking payments and managing your front counter

- Receipt printers for customer copies and order tickets

- Customer-facing SignPad tablets for tips, signatures, and completing digital forms

Punchey uses register sessions to track activity for each drawer or station. To learn more, see [Register Management Basics](/register-management-basics).

Punchey also offers mobile companion apps for Android and iOS. These apps work alongside your desktop or register setup so you can manage the checkout experience even when you are on the move.

These devices plug into your setup through Bluetooth, USB, or a local network, depending on the model you use.

## How device connections work

Each device type connects in a simple, predictable way. The overall flow typically looks like this:

- Power on the device

- Connect it to your register, tablet, or local network

- Run a quick test in Punchey to confirm it is recognized

If you are using a SignPad, the experience is similar. Once powered on, it pairs with your register so customers can review totals, choose tips, sign digitally, and complete required forms.

### General setup flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unbox and power on" icon="power" title-type="p">
    
    Make sure your device is fully powered and, if required, charged before starting any setup tasks. This includes card readers, printers, registers, and your SignPad.
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the device" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    
    Most devices pair over Bluetooth or connect to a local network. Follow your hardware guide to complete the pairing process. Mobile apps connect through your Punchey account and do not require special hardware pairing.
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a quick test" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    
    Open your Punchey register and trigger a test action, such as a test print, dummy card tap, or a sample signature prompt on the SignPad, to confirm everything is working.
  
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to do if something is not working

Most issues come down to connectivity. Try checking:

- The device has power

- Bluetooth or network settings are enabled

- Cables are firmly connected

If you are using the mobile app, make sure your device is connected to the internet and logged in to your Punchey account.

If the device still does not respond, the Punchey Help Center includes detailed troubleshooting steps for each specific model.

## Card readers and terminals

Punchey supports several industry-standard payment terminals commonly used by small businesses. Each provides a different mix of card-present features.

### Magtek card reader

A simple magstripe reader for swipe-only transactions. It plugs in through USB and is typically used with a desktop register. It is reliable, lightweight, and ideal when you only need basic card swipes.

### IDTech VP8300

A compact EMV-ready device that supports chip and contactless payments. It generally pairs over USB or Bluetooth, depending on the model, and works well in busy checkout environments where you need secure chip card authentication.

### Adyen AMS1

A full-featured terminal for chip, tap, and PIN transactions. It is built for higher-volume setups that need a durable, customer-facing device connected through local network or USB.

## SignPad setup and use

The SignPad is a customer-facing tablet experience that displays totals, tips, signatures, and digital intake forms. It fits naturally into your register workflow by giving customers a clear, guided checkout interface.

You can run the SignPad as an app on Android or iPad. When connected to your register through your Punchey account and local network, it automatically syncs each transaction so customers see exactly what you are ringing up.

A typical SignPad flow looks like this:

- The register sends the transaction details to the SignPad

- The SignPad displays the total and available tip options

- The customer signs or completes form fields

- The results are saved back to the ticket in Punchey

## Receipt printers and cash drawers

Punchey supports several thermal receipt printers commonly paired with automatic cash drawers. Typical setups include:

- USB or networked thermal printers for fast receipt and ticket printing

- Cash drawers that open electronically when the printer fires a kick signal

These devices work best when the printer is placed near your register and connected through USB or a stable network. Once the printer is recognized by Punchey, cash drawer triggers work automatically.

## Barcode scanners

Barcode scanners help speed up checkout for retail-style workflows. Most supported scanners operate in keyboard mode, meaning scanned barcodes appear as typed input in the register search field. They typically connect by USB or Bluetooth.

## Device overview and requirements

Punchey works well with modern tablets, desktops, and all-in-one touch registers. For the smoothest checkout experience, choose:

- A current-generation iPad or Android tablet for mobile or SignPad use

- A desktop or touch-enabled device with enough processing power to run your register without delays

- A keyboard that fits your workspace, whether that is a physical keyboard or an on-screen option

Your mix of hardware depends on how your staff moves around the checkout area, whether customers interact directly with a SignPad, and how much counter space you have.
