## Understanding supported devices

Punchey works with a range of common point-of-sale hardware. You can combine these devices to fit your checkout setup:

- Chip and contactless card readers for secure in-person payments

- Magstripe readers for basic swipe transactions

- Registers for taking payments and managing your front counter

- Receipt printers for customer copies and order tickets

- Customer-facing SignPad tablets for tips, signatures, and completing digital forms

Punchey also offers mobile companion apps for Android and iOS. These apps work alongside your desktop or register setup so you can manage the checkout experience even when you are on the move.

These devices plug into your setup through Bluetooth, USB, or a local network, depending on the model you use.

## How device connections work

Each device type connects in a simple, predictable way. The overall flow typically looks like this:

- Power on the device

- Connect it to your register, tablet, or local network

- Run a quick test in Punchey to confirm it is recognized

If you are using a SignPad, the experience is similar. Once powered on, it pairs with your register so customers can review totals, choose tips, sign digitally, and complete required forms.

### General setup flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unbox and power on" icon="power" title-type="p">
    Make sure your device is fully powered and, if required, charged before starting any setup tasks. This includes card readers, printers, registers, and your SignPad.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the device" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    Most devices pair over Bluetooth or connect to a local network. Follow your hardware guide to complete the pairing process. Mobile apps connect through your Punchey account and do not require special hardware pairing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a quick test" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    Open your Punchey register and trigger a test action, such as a test print, dummy card tap, or a sample signature prompt on the SignPad, to confirm everything is working.
  </Step>

## What to do if something is not working

Most issues come down to connectivity. Try checking:

- The device has power

- Bluetooth or network settings are enabled

- Cables are firmly connected

If you are using the mobile app, make sure your device is connected to the internet and logged in to your Punchey account.

If the device still does not respond, the Punchey Help Center includes detailed troubleshooting steps for each specific model.
