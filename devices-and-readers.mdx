## Understanding supported devices

Punchey works with a range of common point-of-sale hardware. You can combine any of these devices to fit your checkout setup:

- Chip and contactless card readers for secure in‑person payments  
- Magstripe readers for basic swipe transactions  
- Registers for taking payments and managing your front counter  
- Receipt printers for customer copies and order tickets

These devices plug into your setup through Bluetooth, USB, or a local network, depending on the model you use.

## What to do if something is not working

Most issues come down to connectivity. Try checking:

- The device has power  
- Bluetooth or network settings are enabled  
- Cables are firmly connected  

If the device still does not respond, the Resource Center includes detailed troubleshooting steps for each specific model.
