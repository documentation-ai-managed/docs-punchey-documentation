## What gift cards represent in Punchey

Gift cards in Punchey function as stored‑value accounts linked to a unique code. When you issue a gift card, you are creating a liability for your business. The value remains on your books until the customer redeems it through a payment.

Punchey tracks this value automatically. Redemptions reduce the balance, and any remaining amount stays available for later use. Gift cards integrate with your normal payment flows, as outlined in the broader overviews in [Take Payments & Get Paid](/payment-solutions) and [How Money Moves with Punchey](/money-flow).

  Gift cards behave like a prepaid wallet. The card holder is spending stored value rather than initiating a new payment method at the moment of redemption.

## Types of gift cards

Punchey supports both digital and physical formats. The underlying balance and transaction behavior are the same.

    Digital gift cards are issued through your Smart Domain or other online storefront experiences. Customers can purchase them remotely, receive them instantly, and redeem them in person or online.

  <Card title="Physical gift cards" href="/services-products" icon="package" horizontal="false">
    Physical cards function like traditional stored‑value cards. You load value into the card when selling it and your team can swipe, scan, or enter the code during checkout.

## Lifecycle of a gift card

Gift cards follow a consistent lifecycle within Punchey. The exact steps vary by workflow, but the core model is the same.

### Issue

You create or sell a gift card with a specific value. Punchey records the card, assigns a code, and logs the liability. Digital cards surface immediately online; physical cards are activated when sold.

### Redeem

During checkout, the customer presents a physical card or enters a digital code. Punchey applies the available balance. If the card does not cover the full amount, the customer can pay the difference with any supported payment method.

### Track

Redemptions and remaining balances appear in your transaction history and reporting tools. Managers can review issuance, redemption activity, and outstanding liabilities in the standard reporting dashboards available in [Reports](/reports).

  Because gift card liability can span months, regularly reviewing outstanding balances helps ensure accurate accounting.

## How gift cards appear in payments and invoices

Gift cards show up in checkout as an additional tender type. Once a code is applied, Punchey deducts the redeemed amount and records it similar to other forms of payment. The original liability decreases accordingly.

In invoices or Smart Requests, customers can enter their gift card code when paying online. Punchey validates the code, applies the balance, and updates the invoice status.

Gift card transactions appear in the same financial pipeline described in [How Money Moves with Punchey](/money-flow), but without a separate transfer of funds at the time of redemption because the funds were already collected when the card was issued.

## Gift cards for promotions and marketing

Gift cards work well for business growth initiatives. You can pair them with marketing tools covered in the [Marketing](/marketing) overview.

Common uses include:

- Offering digital gift cards through your Smart Domain as a low‑effort revenue driver.

- Using targeted campaigns to prompt customers to gift services to friends or family.

- Running limited‑time promotions or bonus‑value events.

Punchey manages all balances the same way regardless of how the promotion is delivered.
