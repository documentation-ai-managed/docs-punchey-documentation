### Viewing and saving customer statements

Customer profiles include access to financial history and statements, helping you quickly reference past activity or provide documentation to a customer. For practical, step-by-step instructions, see the **View and Save Customer Statements** article in the Help Center.

### Adding or editing a customer contact

You can add new customers or update existing details whenever information changes. Keeping contact records accurate ensures that communication tools, Smart Number messaging, and digital forms all stay connected to the right profile.

## Smart Number and communication tools

Punchey’s communication tools help you keep conversations organized and tied to customer profiles.

### What your Smart Number does

A Smart Number is a business phone number used for calls and text messages through Punchey. It lets you:

- Present a consistent, professional number to customers.

- Route calls and messages through Punchey instead of personal devices.

- Keep a record of conversations alongside each customer’s profile.

You can start with a new Smart Number or, in many cases, port an existing business number so customers keep using the number they already know.

### Message Center and call logging

The Message Center and call logging tools:

- Capture inbound and outbound calls tied to the correct customer.

- Store SMS conversations so your team can see what was discussed.

- Help multiple staff members share context when following up.

This history lives inside the customer’s profile so you can quickly recall what was promised or discussed at a previous visit.

### One-to-one messages vs. campaigns

Direct communication tools are best for:

- Confirmations or quick clarifications about an upcoming appointment.

- One-off follow-ups after a visit.

- Resolving simple questions over text or phone.

When you need to send broader announcements or promotions to many customers at once, Punchey’s marketing tools and integrations such as Mailchimp are a better fit.
