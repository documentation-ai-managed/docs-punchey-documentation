## Understanding the flow of money

This guide explains, in plain language, what happens after you take a payment, how payouts reach your bank, and how fees, tips, taxes, refunds, and disputes affect what you receive. For step-by-step, screen-by-screen instructions, visit the Punchey Help Center at [https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions).

## Taking payments

When you accept a payment, Punchey records the transaction and moves it through several predictable stages. These stages help you understand where the money is and whether it is heading toward a payout.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorization" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    The customer’s bank confirms funds are available. The transaction appears in your activity soon after payment is taken.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Capture and settlement" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    The payment is finalized and prepared for settlement. This usually happens automatically without any action required from you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Included in a batch" icon="package" title-type="p">
    Transactions are grouped before being sent to your bank. Tips, taxes, and any applicable fees can make the batch amount different from the original sale amount.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Status expectations

- **Pending or authorized**: Payment is initiated and funds are being confirmed.

- **Completed or settled**: Funds have been captured and will be included in a future payout.

- **Voided**: The payment was reversed before settlement, so no funds move to or from your bank.

- **Refunded**: Funds have been returned to the customer after settlement.

## Payouts and deposits

Once transactions are settled, they are grouped into payouts that are sent to your bank account.

### What you can expect

- Payouts reflect the net amount after fees, refunds, and adjustments.

- Multiple payouts may occur depending on your transaction volume.

- Large tips or adjustments can cause the payout amount to differ from your collected totals.

## Registers, cash management, and end‑of‑day flow

If you take in-person payments, your **registers** and **cash drawers** sit between individual transactions and your final bank deposits.

Conceptually:

- A **register session** tracks activity for a specific drawer or station over part of a day.

- **Opening a register** records your starting cash and prepares the drawer for checkouts.

- **Closing a register** compares expected totals to what is actually in the drawer and highlights differences.

- **Cash management controls** such as drops or paid-outs help you document movements in or out of the drawer during the day.

These steps do not change how card payments move through the processor, but they are essential for:

- Matching cash and card totals to your reports.

- Catching mistakes or unbalanced drawers quickly.

- Keeping a clean record of who handled a particular register session.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  Think of reports and money flow as the **ledger view** of your business, and register sessions as the **on-the-ground record** of how cash and in-person payments moved throughout the day.
</Callout>

### Deposit schedules and statements

Payouts rarely match a single day's sales exactly. Timing, refunds, adjustments, and processing fees all affect what reaches your bank.

At a high level:

- **Deposit schedules** describe how often payouts are grouped and sent such as daily with a delay of a few business days.

- **Processing statements and fee reports** summarize the fees associated with those payouts.

- **Deposit and fee reports** help you see which sales and adjustments ended up in each bank deposit.

For detailed payout timing, examples, and statement views, see:

- The **Reports** section in the Punchey Help Center:\

## Refunds, voids, and adjustments

Refunds and voids change how and when money moves through your account.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Voids" icon="x-circle">
    Voids happen before settlement. No funds have moved yet, so the original payment will not appear in a payout or return to the customer’s bank.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Refunds" icon="rotate-ccw">
    Refunds happen after settlement. The refunded amount reduces an upcoming payout or may result in a debit depending on timing. Customer bank processing times vary.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Adjustments" icon="settings">
    Adjustments correct details such as tips, taxes, or fees. They appear in your reports and affect the net payout amount.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Disputes and chargebacks

A dispute occurs when a cardholder contacts their bank to challenge a transaction.

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  While a dispute is active, the disputed amount is temporarily withdrawn. You may need to provide documentation. Resolution timelines vary by bank and can take several weeks.
</Callout>

### What to know

- Funds may be placed on hold or reversed until the dispute is resolved.

- Winning a dispute may return the funds in a later payout.

- Losing a dispute makes the reversal permanent.

- Timely documentation matters; see the Help Center for how to respond.

## Fees, taxes, and tips in your records

Different parts of each transaction appear in different places depending on type.

<Expandable title="Fees" default-open="true">
  Payment processing fees are deducted within each payout. You can review them in payout detail reports and transaction summaries.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Taxes" default-open="false">
  Collected taxes appear in your receipts and sales reports. They are part of the transaction total but do not increase your net payout because you remit them separately.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Tips" default-open="false">
  Tips are included in the transaction total and flow into payout batches. Distributing tips to staff depends on your internal processes.
</Expandable>
