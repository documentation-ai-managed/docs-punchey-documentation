## Why centralized communication matters

Keeping all calls and texts tied to the correct customer profile is a major part of how Punchey supports daily operations, follow-up, and long-term engagement. When communication is centralized, you get a complete history of conversations, fewer missed messages, and a clearer view of each relationship.

  Centralized communication ensures that every call or text contributes to the customer record, making it easier for you and your team to respond consistently and provide better service.

This page gives you a conceptual overview of the communication tools in Punchey, how they connect to your CRM, and how they differ from broader marketing campaigns.

## The Smart Number

The Smart Number is your business’s dedicated phone number inside Punchey. It allows your team to send and receive texts, route calls, and log communication directly to customer profiles.

### What problems it solves

- Team members can communicate from a shared business number instead of personal phones.

- All calls and texts are automatically tied to customers when their profile exists.

- If a number is not recognized, Punchey prompts you to link or create the correct customer profile.

- Helps maintain compliance for text messaging and opt-in requirements.

  If you already have an established business phone number, you can port it into Punchey so customers can continue using the number they know.

### Creating or requesting your Smart Number

Most businesses start by creating or requesting a Smart Number during setup. This ensures you have a dedicated line for customer communication from day one. For a guided walkthrough of the setup process, see the Creating your Smart Number article in the Get Started section under Integrations and Contact Tools.

### Porting an existing number

If your business already uses a well-known phone number, you can port it into Punchey so customers keep contacting the number they recognize. To understand eligibility, timing, and what to expect during the transition, see the How to Port Your Existing Number to Become Your Smart Number article in the Manage Your Account and Billing section.

For number porting or configuration options, see Manage Your Account and Billing at `/manage-account-billing`.

## Everyday calling and texting with your Smart Number

Your Smart Number works for both inbound and outbound calls and texts. This ensures a consistent customer experience regardless of who on your team is communicating.

- You can call or text customers from within Punchey without exposing personal phone numbers.

- Incoming calls and texts automatically route into Punchey and link to the correct customer when possible.

- Your team shares the same conversation history, so any staff member can pick up where another left off.

For an overview of daily calling and messaging workflows, see the How to Call or Text Using Your Smart Number article in the Customers and Forms section.

## Message Center

Message Center is the hub for all incoming and outgoing SMS conversations. It works like a shared inbox, giving your team a unified place to respond and track message history.

### How Message Center connects to customer profiles

- When a known customer texts your Smart Number, the thread appears with their name, details, and history.

- Messages are stored in the customer profile, giving you a full timeline alongside forms, invoices, visits, and payments.

- You can start a new conversation directly from a customer’s profile or from Message Center.

  The goal is to make communication feel continuous, no matter which staff member responds.

## Call logging

Punchey automatically logs calls made to or from the Smart Number. This gives you a complete history of interactions, just like message threads.

### What call logging captures

- Call direction and timestamp.

- Call status, such as completed or missed.

- A link to the customer or a prompt to link if the number is new.

Logged calls help you understand communication patterns and ensure no follow-up slips through the cracks.

## Everyday messaging vs. marketing campaigns

Punchey supports two main types of communication.

### Direct, one-to-one conversations

These take place through Message Center and are tied to specific customers. You use them for:

- Appointment reminders you manually send.

- Quick updates about an order or service.

- Follow-up after a visit.

This is person-to-person communication and requires no campaign setup.

### Marketing and bulk messaging

Marketing tools let you send messages to groups of customers or run automated campaigns. These tools live separately from your everyday conversations and include features for targeting, scheduling, and compliance.

For details on promotional messaging, see Marketing at `/marketing`.

## How communication tools support CRM and marketing

Communication tools are a core part of how Punchey connects your operational workflow with customer relationship management.

They support CRM by:

- Adding message and call history to customer profiles.

- Helping you identify active, new, and at-risk customers.

- Making it easier to follow up, request reviews, or send reminders.

They support marketing by:

- Allowing you to segment customers based on communication history.

- Providing clean, structured contact data for integrations and outreach tools through the Integrations and Contact Tools section (see `/marketing` for related setup guidance).
