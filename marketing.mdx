## What you can do

### Send timely reminders

Use built‑in reminders to let customers know about upcoming appointments, order pickups, or follow‑ups. These simple text or email messages help reduce no‑shows and keep your workflow running smoothly.

### Share light promotions

When you have a seasonal offer or a quick sale, you can send a short broadcast message to your customers. These messages are designed to be straightforward and easy to set up without advanced targeting.

### Send thank‑you messages

A brief thank‑you after a visit or purchase helps strengthen long‑term relationships. Punchey makes it quick to send a friendly follow‑up that shows your appreciation.

## Example campaigns

The following sample sequences show how simple, well‑timed messages can help you stay connected with customers throughout their experience with your business. These ideas use everyday timing and broad audience groups, keeping things easy to manage.

### New customer welcome

A welcome sequence helps first‑time visitors feel appreciated and encourages them to return.

- Same day: A short thank‑you message after their first‑time visit.

- A few days later: A helpful tip or invitation to book again.

- Within a couple of weeks: A friendly nudge to check in or explore another service.

This approach is aimed at brand‑new customers who have recently completed their first visit.

### We haven’t seen you in a while

A re‑engagement message is a gentle way to reconnect with customers who have not visited in some time.

- After weeks or months of no activity: A simple message acknowledging their absence.

- Shortly after: A light reminder or suggestion for a service they previously used.

This type of sequence typically targets regulars or semi‑regulars who have skipped their usual visit cycle.

### Birthday or anniversary nudges

When you track special dates, timely messages help show customers you value them.

- A few days before the date: A warm note acknowledging their birthday or visit anniversary.

- On the date: A celebratory message or prompt to stop by.

- Shortly after: A friendly follow‑up that extends the sentiment.

These messages work well for customers who have shared their important dates.

## Smart Domain, deals, and integrations

Punchey’s marketing tools are most effective when they point customers to a clear, consistent destination and work together with your other systems.

### Smart Domain: your branded destination

A Smart Domain is a branded web address where customers can book appointments, view featured deals, purchase gift cards, and access other self‑service tools. This consistent destination reinforces your branding and makes it easier to share a single link across messages, your website, and social media.

Configuring your Smart Domain influences:

- How customers discover booking, deals, and gift card options.

- How your brand appears across text and email campaigns.

- How your CRM, reviews, and appointment tools funnel customers to the same place.

To learn how to set up your Smart Domain, see the Freshdesk article [How to Configure your Smart Domain](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/158000689060).

### Highlighting promotions and deals

Featuring deals on your Smart Domain or website lets you promote seasonal offers, bundles, and add‑on services without redesigning your site. These promotions can be used alongside reminders, follow‑ups, and email campaigns to drive bookings or purchases.

This works well when you want to:

- Align offers with CRM segments or typical visit cycles.

- Provide quick purchasing paths for gift cards or service packages.

- Highlight time‑sensitive opportunities during busy seasons.

For a high‑level walkthrough, see the Freshdesk guide [Adding Deals to Your Website](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/158000689061).

### Email and text marketing integrations

For more advanced campaigns, Punchey integrates with tools like Mailchimp. Connecting an external platform allows you to run deeper segmentation, automate multi‑step flows, and tie messages to purchase or visit history.

Conceptually, integrations help you:

- Sync customer lists from CRM tools.

- Create targeted campaigns based on services, purchase trends, or reviews activity.

- Track which messages convert to appointments or sales.

To learn how to connect Mailchimp, see the Freshdesk article [Integrate Your MailChimp Account](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/158000689062).
