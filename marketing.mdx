## What you can do

### Send timely reminders

Use built‑in reminders to let customers know about upcoming appointments, order pickups, or follow‑ups. These simple text or email messages help reduce no‑shows and keep your workflow running smoothly.

### Share light promotions

When you have a seasonal offer or a quick sale, you can send a short broadcast message to your customers. These messages are designed to be straightforward and easy to set up without advanced targeting.

### Send thank‑you messages

A brief thank‑you after a visit or purchase helps strengthen long‑term relationships. Punchey makes it quick to send a friendly follow‑up that shows your appreciation.

## Example campaigns

The following sample sequences show how simple, well‑timed messages can help you stay connected with customers throughout their experience with your business. These ideas use everyday timing and broad audience groups, keeping things easy to manage.

### New customer welcome

A welcome sequence helps first‑time visitors feel appreciated and encourages them to return.

- Same day: A short thank‑you message after their first‑time visit, reinforcing a positive experience.

- A few days later: A helpful tip, quick reminder about popular services, or an invitation to book again.

- Within a couple of weeks: A friendly nudge to check in or explore another service they may find useful.

This approach is aimed at brand‑new customers who have recently completed their first visit.

### We haven’t seen you in a while

A re‑engagement message is a gentle way to reconnect with customers who have not visited in some time.

- After several weeks or months of no activity: A simple message that says you noticed their absence and would be happy to see them again.

- Follow‑up shortly after: A light reminder or suggestion for a service they previously used.

This type of sequence typically targets regulars or semi‑regulars who have skipped their usual visit cycle.

### Birthday or anniversary nudges

When you track special dates, timely messages help show customers you value them.

- A few days before the date: A warm note acknowledging their birthday or visit anniversary.

- On the date itself: A celebratory message or a gentle prompt to stop by when convenient.

- Shortly after: A friendly follow‑up that extends the sentiment without pressure.

These messages work well for customers who have shared their important dates through forms or profiles.

## Smart Domain, deals, and integrations

Punchey’s marketing tools are most effective when they point customers to a clear, consistent destination and work together with your other systems.

### Smart Domain: your branded destination

A **Smart Domain** is a branded web address where customers can:

- Book online appointments.

- View featured deals or packages.

- Purchase gift cards and access other self‑service tools.

Using a Smart Domain keeps your booking, promotions, and customer‑facing tools in one easy‑to‑share location, whether you link to it from your website, social channels, or text and email messages.

### Highlighting promotions and deals

Punchey allows you to feature **deals** on your website or Smart Domain, such as seasonal offers or limited‑time packages.

Conceptually, this lets you:

- Promote specific services or bundles without redesigning your whole site.

- Align deals with campaigns you send by text or email.

- Make it easy for customers to claim or purchase offers in just a few steps.

### Email and text marketing integrations

For more advanced campaigns, you can connect Punchey to tools like **Mailchimp**:

- Sync customer lists or audiences from Punchey.

- Run targeted email campaigns that reflect real purchase or visit history.

- Track which messages lead to bookings or sales.

These integrations complement Punchey’s built‑in reminders and simple broadcasts by handling more complex segmentation and automation.
