## What you can do

### Send timely reminders

Use built‑in reminders to let customers know about upcoming appointments, order pickups, or follow‑ups. These simple text or email messages help reduce no‑shows and keep your workflow running smoothly.

### Share light promotions

When you have a seasonal offer or a quick sale, you can send a short broadcast message to your customers. These messages are designed to be straightforward and easy to set up without advanced targeting.

### Send thank‑you messages

A brief thank‑you after a visit or purchase helps strengthen long‑term relationships. Punchey makes it quick to send a friendly follow‑up that shows your appreciation.
