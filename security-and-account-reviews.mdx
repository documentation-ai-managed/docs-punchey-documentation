## How Punchey protects payment and customer data

Punchey is designed to keep your business and customer information secure without requiring you to become a security expert.

- All data exchanged with Punchey is sent through SSL-secured channels.

- Sensitive payment information is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

- Payment data is handled in a PCI-compliant environment and stored in a secure payment vault so you never need to deal with raw card details yourself.

  Punchey’s privacy policy (available from your dashboard) explains how data is protected and used. It is written to be approachable for business owners rather than technical specialists.

## What to expect from verification and account reviews

Occasionally, Punchey may request additional information to confirm account details or ensure that recent activity aligns with expected business patterns. These reviews are part of standard risk and compliance practices in payment systems.
