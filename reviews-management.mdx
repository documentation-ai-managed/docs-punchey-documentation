## Connecting your Google Business account

Linking your Google Business account allows Punchey to automate review collection by directing customers to your verified listing after their visit. This increases the likelihood of timely, high-quality reviews while ensuring they appear on a platform customers already trust.

You can find the detailed setup steps in the Help Center article on **Connecting Your Google Business Account for Automated Reviews**.

## Setting up your company spokesperson

Punchey allows you to define a company spokesperson whose name and image appear in outbound review requests. This helps personalize outreach and improves customer engagement by presenting a consistent, trustworthy identity.

See the Help Center article on **Setting up Your Company Spokesperson** for configuration steps.

## Automated review requests

Automated review requests help you gather feedback consistently without adding administrative work. After a visit or completed service, Punchey can automatically send a customized review request to the customer, guiding them to your preferred review channels.

You can configure triggers, timing, and messaging in the Help Center article titled **Setting up Automated Review Requests**.
