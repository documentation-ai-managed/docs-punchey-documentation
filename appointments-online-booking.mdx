## How booking works at a high level

Online booking is built around a few simple building blocks: your business hours, your bookable services, and a link you share with clients.

### Set your business hours

You choose when clients can request an appointment. These hours help prevent unexpected bookings and keep your availability clear.

### Add the services you want clients to book

Each service includes a name, description, and duration. Setting these details ensures that your calendar always reflects the right amount of time needed for each appointment.

### Share your booking link with clients

Once your hours and services are ready, you get a unique booking link. You can add it to your website, social media pages, email signature, or text it directly to clients. When clients use this link, appointments flow straight into your calendar.

## What you can do each day

- Review your upcoming schedule at a glance.
- See new online bookings as they come in.
- Manage cancellations or rescheduling without losing track of important details.
