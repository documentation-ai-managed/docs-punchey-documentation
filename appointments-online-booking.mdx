## How booking works at a high level

Online booking is built around a few simple building blocks: your business hours, your bookable services, and a link you share with clients.

### Set your business hours

You choose when clients can request an appointment. These hours help prevent unexpected bookings and keep your availability clear.

### Add the services you want clients to book

Each service includes a name, description, and duration. Setting these details ensures that your calendar always reflects the right amount of time needed for each appointment.

### Share your booking link with clients

Once your hours and services are ready, you get a unique booking link. You can add it to your website, social media pages, email signature, or text it directly to clients. When clients use this link, appointments flow straight into your calendar.

## Ways to create an appointment

You can create appointments in several places depending on your workflow. These options match the four methods described in the Help Center article titled "How to Create an Appointment: Four Ways" and its related pages.

### Create from quick actions

Quick actions let you add an appointment no matter where you are in the system. This is useful when you need to schedule a visit while working in another part of Punchey.

### Create from the daily schedule

The daily schedule provides a focused view of your current day. Creating directly from this view helps you place appointments into open time slots with confidence.

### Create from the calendar view

The calendar view lets you browse days, weeks, or staff schedules. Creating from this screen is ideal when you need to look across multiple upcoming days.

### Create from existing booking details or customer records

You can also book time when viewing a customer's CRM profile or while managing an existing appointment. This keeps your notes, forms, and task history connected.

## Scheduling and staff tools

The scheduling tools in Punchey help you manage staff availability, adjust booking details, and organize your calendars.

### Staff scheduler tool

The staff scheduler tool gives you a way to review staff availability and manage assignments. This helps ensure clients are only booked with providers who are available and properly configured in your Team and Locations settings.

### Edit a booking's price

You can adjust the price of an appointment when service details change. This is especially useful when add-ons or customizations affect the final cost at checkout.

### Edit appointment tags

Tags help categorize appointments. You can add or edit tags to track visit types, service categories, or other internal notes that make reporting and communication easier.

### Add another calendar or schedule

Businesses with multiple staff, locations, or rooms can add extra calendars or schedules. This keeps availability cleanly separated across teams and makes booking logic more accurate.

## Optional Google Calendar sync

You can connect your Punchey appointments to Google Calendar for personal visibility or team coordination. This integration sends appointments outward to your Google Calendar so you always have your schedule available. Configuration steps are provided in the Help Center article on syncing Google Calendar.

## How deposits work for online booking

Deposit settings let you require clients to pre-pay or partially pay when booking online. This helps reduce no-shows and ensures commitment before the appointment appears on your calendar. You can configure minimum amounts, deposit logic, and payment expectations within Payment Solutions settings.

For more details, see the Help Center article titled "How Deposit Settings Work for Online Booking."

## What you can do each day

- Review your upcoming schedule at a glance.

- See new online bookings as they come in.

- Manage cancellations or rescheduling without losing track of important details.

## How this connects to the rest of Punchey

Online booking works together with other core tools:

- CRM Tools store customer details, visit history, and forms. See [Customers and Forms](/crm-tools).

- Team and Locations settings determine which staff and stations can be booked. Visit [Team and Locations](/team-and-locations).

- Payment Solutions lets you collect deposits or take payment at checkout for booked services. See [Take Payments and Get Paid](/payment-solutions).
