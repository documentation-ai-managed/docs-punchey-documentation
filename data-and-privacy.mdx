## How this data is used

Punchey uses stored information to operate and improve core services such as payments, scheduling, messaging, and CRM tools. Data may also be used to help address support requests or resolve account issues.

Punchey does not sell or rent personal information to third parties.

## Exporting or removing your information

You can access most of your business and customer data directly in Punchey. Common options include:

- Exporting customer lists, transactions, or reports from your dashboard.

- Downloading appointment or form data for your records.

- Requesting additional exports or removals by contacting Punchey Support if something is not available through self‑service tools.

For information about managing account‑level settings, billing records, and related controls, visit [Manage Your Account & Billing](/manage-account-billing).

## How long data is retained

Punchey generally keeps data while your account is active so that your business can continue operating without interruption. Certain information may be retained after closure when needed to meet financial, accounting, or legal requirements.

If you have specific retention questions, you can contact Punchey Support for guidance based on your account setup. Additional account and billing management details are available in [Manage Your Account & Billing](/manage-account-billing).

## When a customer asks about their data

If a customer wants a copy of their information or asks that you remove what you have stored about them, they should first contact your business directly. You can then use the available tools in your Punchey account or contact Support to help you reply to the request.
