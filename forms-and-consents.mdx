## What forms and consents are for

Digital forms help you collect the information you need before, during, or after a visit without relying on paper. Many businesses use them for intake details, waivers, consents, and questionnaires that keep staff informed and customers protected.

Using digital forms keeps records consistent, reduces manual data entry, and makes onboarding smoother for both new and returning customers.

## How forms connect to customers and visits

Forms attach directly to customer profiles, allowing staff to review submitted information at any time. When a customer has an upcoming appointment, relevant forms appear alongside visit details so your team always knows what has been completed and what still needs attention.

This connection keeps data organized and ensures that important acknowledgements or consents are never misplaced.

## Using forms with SignPad and mobile

Punchey supports customer-facing SignPad devices that display digital forms, signatures, and consents. Customers can complete everything at check-in or during a service, reducing bottlenecks at the front desk.

Mobile devices allow staff to view schedules and visit details on the go, including submitted forms, so the right information is always accessible.

  SignPad forms also support signatures and tipping, making them a natural part of the check-in and checkout flow. For help with setup and usage details, see the **Using Digital Forms with your SignPad** article in the Punchey Help Center.

## Record keeping and privacy expectations

Once completed, forms become part of each customer's long-term record. Staff can review them whenever needed, and the information helps maintain consistent service and clear history.

Because forms often contain personal details, they should be handled responsibly. Teams should only access the information they need and follow your business policies for privacy and data handling.

## Advanced form customization

Most businesses start with standard intake forms, waivers, and consent documents. As your workflows mature, you may want more advanced control over how forms look and how they connect to your data.

Punchey supports advanced customization options that let you:

- Build **custom forms and documents** that pull in fields from your Punchey database.

- Create branded templates for multi-page waivers or consent packets.

- Generate documents that reflect up-to-date customer information without retyping it.

These tools are especially helpful if you have strict compliance needs, complex consent requirements, or multi-location branding standards. More technical examples are available in the **Creating Custom Forms and Documents from your Punchey Database** article, included in the Advanced Customization section linked below.
