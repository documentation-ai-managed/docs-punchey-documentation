## Morning setup

### 1. Check today’s schedule

- Open **Appointments & Online Booking** to review the day’s calendar.

- Confirm new online bookings and any last‑minute changes.

- Identify gaps where you may fit in additional appointments.

### 2. Confirm forms and customer details

- In **CRM Tools**, review which clients need intake or consent forms.

- Send required forms ahead of time so clients can complete them on their phone.

- Note returning clients with important history in their profile (preferences, prior services, notes).

### 3. Prepare devices and stations

- Make sure your registers and card readers are powered on and connected.

- Confirm your **SignPad** is paired so it can display totals, tips, signatures, and digital forms.

- If you use the mobile app, sign in and verify you can see today’s schedule.

## During the day: greeting and service

### 4. Check‑in at the front desk

- Greet the client and pull up their profile from **CRM Tools**.

- Confirm services for this visit and update contact details if needed.

- If any forms are incomplete, hand the client the SignPad or send the form to their device.

### 5. Use forms during the visit

- Capture consent, intake details, or service‑specific information digitally.

- Completed forms attach to the customer record automatically.

- Staff can review forms from their own station or mobile device if needed.

### 6. Keep an eye on the rest of the day

- Periodically review the appointments calendar for late arrivals or cancellations.

- Adjust staffing or room usage based on real‑time demand.

## Checkout and payments

### 7. Build the invoice

- From the register, add the services performed and any products sold.

- Confirm pricing, discounts, and taxes match what was discussed.

### 8. Use the SignPad for customer review

- Push the invoice to the SignPad so the client can review the total.

- The client selects a tip, if applicable, and signs digitally.

- Any required forms or acknowledgements can be completed on the SignPad at the same time.

### 9. Complete payment and receipts

- Finalize the payment using the customer’s chosen method.

- Offer an emailed, texted, or printed receipt.

- Confirm that the visit and payment appear correctly in the customer’s history.

  A consistent SignPad flow keeps checkout smooth: staff stay focused on the conversation while customers handle tips and signatures on their own screen.

## After each visit

### 10. Follow up with customers

- Send a quick thank‑you message or follow‑up reminder if needed.

- Use **Reviews Management** to trigger a polite review request for happy clients.

### 11. Update notes and records

- Add brief visit notes to the customer profile.

- Record any special preferences that will help with future appointments.

## End‑of‑day wrap‑up

### 12. Light reporting review

- Open **Reports** to check daily totals and key metrics.

- Look at which services and products were most popular.

- Confirm any outstanding balances or follow‑ups that should be carried into tomorrow.

### 13. Device and location checks

- Sign out from shared stations or lock screens at the front desk.

- Ensure your SignPad and readers are placed securely and charging.

- If you have multiple locations, verify that activity appears under the correct location in your reports.

## On the go with the mobile app

Owners and staff who are away from the front desk can still stay connected:

- View daily or weekly schedules from a phone.

- See key client details before arriving on site.

- Monitor online bookings and cancellations in real time.

- Check high‑level performance without logging in to a desktop.
