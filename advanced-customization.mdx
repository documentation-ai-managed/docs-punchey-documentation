  A conceptual overview of how advanced customization works in Punchey,
  including custom forms and dynamically generated documents built from your
  Punchey data.

## What advanced customization means

Advanced customization gives you deeper control over how your business collects information and generates documents in Punchey. While standard tools like [Forms & Consents](/forms-and-consents) and [CRM Tools](/crm-tools) cover most day‑to‑day needs, some businesses require more tailored workflows, branded documents, or multi-step intake experiences.

These advanced options let you structure forms and documents that draw directly from your Punchey data so that every field, page, and output reflects your unique requirements.

## How it builds on standard forms and CRM data

Standard forms handle common scenarios such as intake questions, waivers, consents, and simple information gathering. Advanced customization expands this foundation by allowing you to:

- Combine multiple forms or pages into a single, cohesive packet.

- Create branded layouts that match your business identity.

- Auto-fill documents with customer, appointment, or product details from your Punchey records.

- Apply logic that builds different outputs depending on the situation or service.

Because these tools connect directly to the same customer and visit information you manage in the CRM, they help maintain consistency across your workflows while reducing duplicate data collection.

## Common use cases

### Multi-page waivers and agreements

Some businesses need lengthy or multi-part legal documents. Advanced customization lets you structure multi-page or multi-section packets that customers can complete in a single flow.

### Branded intake packets

You can design full intake packets that match your brand style. These packets can pull customer details, past visit history, or relevant service information automatically from your database.

### Dynamically filled documents

When you need a document that changes based on customer information or appointment context, advanced customization allows fields to populate automatically. This reduces manual editing and ensures documents stay accurate.

### Complex or conditional consent requirements

If your services involve age restrictions, service-specific disclosures, or multi-party agreements, you can configure layered consent logic that ensures customers see and sign exactly what is required.

## Where advanced customization fits in your workflow

Advanced customization is most useful when you need to unify forms, documents, and data-driven outputs into a single, cohesive process. It supports scenarios that go beyond the capabilities of standard forms, but it still relies on the same foundation of secure data practices.

If your workflow touches sensitive or regulated information, review the guidance in [Data & Privacy Basics](/data-and-privacy) and [Security, Compliance & Account Reviews](/security-and-account-reviews) to ensure your customized documents follow recommended practices.
