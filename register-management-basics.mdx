## What register management is

Register management adds structure to in‑person checkout operations. A register session tracks activity for a single cash drawer or checkout station over part of a day.

Punchey uses register sessions to create a clear chain between:

- Individual transactions at the front desk.
- Cash drawer movements such as drops and paid‑outs.
- End‑of‑day reporting and reconciliation.

This mirrors the conceptual flow described in [How Money Moves with Punchey](/money-flow).

## What happens in a register session

A session generally includes three phases:

### Opening the register

- You confirm the starting cash in the drawer.
- Punchey uses this amount as the baseline for the day.
- Staff and managers can verify that the drawer begins with the correct float.

### Operating the register during the day

- Every in‑person payment updates the session totals.
- Cash, card, and mixed‑tender transactions all roll into the same session summary.
- Drops and paid‑outs document when cash is removed for safety or used for store needs. Recording these movements protects staff and simplifies reconciliation later.
- Mobile registers can be used for off‑site or field work when you need a separate session away from your main location.

### Closing the register

- You count the drawer and compare it against the session’s expected totals.
- Differences are highlighted so you can resolve issues before they affect end‑of‑day reports.
- Closing also locks the session, which supports security, cash control, and accurate reporting.

## How registers relate to your devices

Register sessions sit between your hardware and your transaction history.

### Cash drawers

- Each drawer corresponds to one register session.
- Staff should never share a drawer without recording a session switch, because it changes who is accountable for the funds.

### Card terminals and SignPad

- Chip, tap, and swipe transactions from your terminals automatically post into the active register session.
- When using SignPad, signatures and on‑screen confirmations are captured but the payment still lands in the correct session.

### Mobile registers

- Field teams or mobile staff can open a separate session on their device.
- This keeps off‑site cash and card activity separate from the main front‑desk drawer.

## Why consistent register habits matter

Good register hygiene protects your business and helps your team:

- Accurate reconciliation  
  Opening and closing sessions ensure your drawer counts match your transaction totals.

- Security and accountability  
  Drops and paid‑outs create an audit trail so managers can see when and why cash moved.

- Reliable reporting  
  Sessions flow directly into [Reports](/reports), giving managers clear summaries of cash, card, and adjustments per location or employee.

- Clear staffing and location controls  
  Register activity links closely with team roles and checkout points. For more on staff permissions and station setup, see [Team & Locations](/team-and-locations).
