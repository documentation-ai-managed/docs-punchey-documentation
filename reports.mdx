## What reports help you understand

Reports give you a clear, simple view of how your business is performing. They show how much money came in, which services customers choose most often, and how your results change over time.

You can use them to spot trends, understand busy periods, and make decisions based on real activity instead of guesswork.

## Common questions reports can answer

- How much revenue did I make this week or month?
- Which services or products generate the most sales?
- Are my sales trending up, down, or staying steady?
- How many customers came in during a specific time period?
- Which staff members are driving the most business?

## When to use reports

Reports are most useful when you want to:

- Review business performance at the end of a day, week, or month.
- Compare current results to past periods.
- Understand whether certain services are growing in demand.
- Identify opportunities to adjust staffing, scheduling, or pricing.

## Example: spotting trends quickly

Here is a simple flow that many business owners follow when checking performance:

1. Open the Reports section.  
2. Choose the date range you want to review.  
3. View your revenue totals for that period.  
4. Look at your top‑performing services to understand what is driving results.

This quick snapshot helps you see how your business is doing without digging through complex data.

## Owner snapshot

Owners often benefit from a short weekly review that keeps them grounded in the overall health of the business without diving into every detail. The most helpful views typically include:

- **Revenue over time:** A quick chart or summary showing whether weekly or monthly totals are rising, holding steady, or dipping. This gives you a clear sense of momentum.
- **Top services:** A simple list showing which services are driving the most activity. When the same few services consistently bring in most revenue, it can guide pricing, promotion, and scheduling decisions.
- **Payout summaries:** A high‑level view of how much money actually reached your bank account, reflecting adjustments, refunds, and fees. This helps ensure expectations match real deposits.

Together, these snapshots offer a reliable pulse check without requiring daily deep dives.

## Staff performance

Reports can help you understand how staff contribute to business performance and where coaching or support may help. Useful concepts include:

- **Visits or revenue by staff member:** Shows how often each team member sees customers and the value of the work they complete.
- **Rebook or return patterns:** Where available, this can highlight which staff members build strong client relationships and where additional follow‑up or training may boost retention.
- **Service mix by staff:** Reveals which services each staff member performs most often, helping you adjust schedules, training plans, or marketing efforts.

These insights can make staffing decisions more objective and help you support your team effectively.

## Inventory and services insight

If you offer both services and products, reports help you understand how each contributes to the business:

- **Top‑selling products:** Identifies items that consistently move, helping you restock confidently and avoid shortages.
- **Underused or low‑activity services:** Shows offerings that may benefit from promotion, bundling, or updating.
- **Patterns over time:** Looking at service and product performance side by side helps you spot emerging interests, seasonal demand shifts, or areas to streamline.

These views make it easier to prioritize what to promote, stock, or adjust.

## Payouts and statements overview

Payouts summarize the actual funds transferred to your bank account, which often differ from the total sales you see in revenue reports. As explained in the **How Money Moves with Punchey** page, fees, refunds, adjustments, and timing differences mean that a payout rarely matches a single day's transactions exactly.

High‑level payout or statement summaries help you understand:

- **Total amount deposited:** The final amount after all adjustments.
- **Which transactions or batches were included:** So you can compare sales activity with funds received.
- **Adjustments, fees, and refunds:** Providing clarity on why the final deposit amount differs from gross sales.

These views connect your sales activity to real‑world cash flow, giving you confidence that everything aligns across reports and bank statements.
