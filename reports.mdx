## What reports help you understand

Reports give you a clear, simple view of how your business is performing. They show how much money came in, which services customers choose most often, and how your results change over time.

You can use them to spot trends, understand busy periods, and make decisions based on real activity instead of guesswork.

## Common questions reports can answer

- How much revenue did I make this week or month?
- Which services or products generate the most sales?
- Are my sales trending up, down, or staying steady?
- How many customers came in during a specific time period?
- Which staff members are driving the most business?
