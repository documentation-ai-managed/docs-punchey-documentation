## What reports help you understand

Reports give you a clear, simple view of how your business is performing. They show how much money came in, which services customers choose most often, and how your results change over time.

You can use them to spot trends, understand busy periods, and make decisions based on real activity instead of guesswork.

## Common questions reports can answer

- How much revenue did I make this week or month?

- Which services or products generate the most sales?

- Are my sales trending up, down, or staying steady?

- How many customers came in during a specific time period?

- Which staff members are driving the most business?

## When to use reports

Reports are most useful when you want to:

- Review business performance at the end of a day, week, or month.

- Compare current results to past periods.

- Understand whether certain services are growing in demand.

- Identify opportunities to adjust staffing, scheduling, or pricing.

## Example: spotting trends quickly

Here is a simple flow that many business owners follow when checking performance:

1. Open the Reports section.

2. Choose the date range you want to review.

3. View your revenue totals for that period.

4. Look at your top-performing services to understand what is driving results.

This quick snapshot helps you see how your business is doing without digging through complex data.

## Ledger balances and billing statements

Sometimes you need a clear picture of what customers owe, how their balances have changed, or how to send formal billing documents. Printing or exporting ledger balances gives you a simple financial snapshot for individual customers or groups, while billing statements help you communicate charges and outstanding amounts clearly.

These tools are most useful when reconciling accounts, preparing month-end summaries, or sending customers a record of their activity.

For more on how these exports work, see the Help Center article:\
[How To Print or Export Ledger Balances and Send Billing Statements](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/158000949154).

## Commission reports

Commission reporting helps you understand how much each staff member has earned based on the services they perform and the compensation rules your business applies. These reports surface the work staff contributed to, the value of that work, and how commissions are calculated.

They help answer questions like:

- Which team members produced the most commissionable revenue.

- How commissions align with overall sales performance.

- Whether compensation plans match the activity happening in your business.

## Owner snapshot

Owners often benefit from a short weekly review that keeps them grounded in the overall health of the business without diving into every detail. The most helpful views typically include:

- Revenue over time: A quick chart or summary showing whether weekly or monthly totals are rising, holding steady, or dipping.

- Top services: A simple list showing which services are driving the most activity.

- Payout summaries: A high-level view of how much money actually reached your bank account after adjustments, refunds, and fees.

Together, these snapshots offer a reliable pulse check without requiring daily deep dives.

## Staff performance

Reports can help you understand how staff contribute to business performance and where coaching or support may help. Useful concepts include:

- Visits or revenue by staff member.

- Rebook or return patterns.

- Service mix by staff.

These insights can make staffing decisions more objective and help you support your team effectively.

## Inventory and services insight

If you offer both services and products, reports help you understand how each contributes to the business:

- Top-selling products.

- Underused or low-activity services.

- Patterns over time.

These views make it easier to prioritize what to promote, stock, or adjust.

## Payouts and statements overview

Payouts summarize the actual funds transferred to your bank account, which often differ from the total sales you see in revenue reports. As explained in the [How Money Moves with Punchey](/money-flow) page, timing differences, fees, refunds, and adjustments mean that a payout rarely matches a single day's revenue exactly.

Beyond payouts, additional deposit and processing reports help you see:

- Total amount deposited and when it hit your bank.

- Which batches or transactions were included in each deposit.

- Processing fees, assessments, and other adjustments.

For more detail, see the articles:

- [How to View your Deposits from Punchey](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/158000949156)

- [How to View Credit Card Processing Statements and Fee Reports](https://puncheyteam.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/158000949157)

These views give you confidence that money flow, deposits, and fees reconcile with what you see in daily sales and activity.

## Understanding financial statements

Financial statement reports give you a broader understanding of profitability, accounting impact, and operational efficiency. Conceptually, these reports help you answer:

- Whether you are viewing results on a cash basis or an accrual basis.

- How labor cost, FRHs, and hourly fields contribute to margins.

- How gross margin varies across services, staff, or locations.

They connect day-to-day work to financial performance, helping you make informed decisions about pricing, staffing, and cost management.
