## What you can manage with services and products

Punchey helps you keep track of everything you sell, including service-based work such as tattoo sessions or car detailing packages, and physical items such as aftercare kits or cleaning supplies. Managing these items in one place ensures your checkout process, pricing, and reporting stay accurate and consistent.

## Organizing what you sell

Clear organization makes it easier for your staff to ring up sales quickly and ensures your reports reflect what is actually happening in your business.

### Services

Service items represent the time or expertise you provide. You can:

- Add service names and descriptions.
- Set standard pricing or package rates.
- Group services into categories, such as "Tattooing", "Detailing", or "Consultations".

This helps streamline your checkout flow and keeps your revenue reporting aligned with the type of work performed.

### Products

Products represent the physical goods you keep in stock. You can:

- Add product names, variations, and prices.
- Track quantities as inventory moves with each sale.
- Categorize products to stay organized across teams or locations.

Tracking products in Punchey keeps your stock counts current and reduces manual reconciliation.

## How it connects to payments

Your services and products appear directly in your checkout flow, allowing you to tap or search for items when taking a payment. Punchey automatically associates each sale with the correct service or product, so your revenue and inventory reporting stay accurate.
